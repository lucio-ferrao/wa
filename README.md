# wassup

A WhatsApp client for the terminal, inspired by [wechit](https://github.com/LingDong-/wechit). It connects as a
"linked device" through the [baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) library, keeps everything in a local
SQLite database and draws the interface with panels, mouse and images right in the terminal.

## Running

```sh
npm install -g github:lucio-ferrao/wassup --allow-git=all --install-links
wa              # from anywhere: opens on the chat list
wa emma         # opens straight into the chat whose name or number contains "emma"
```

`--install-links` makes npm put a real copy in place: without it npm 11 links the package to a temporary clone it then
deletes, and the install fails ("spawn sh ENOENT" in `node_modules/baileys`) or ends up empty. `--allow-git=all` lets
npm 12 install from GitHub, which it refuses by default (npm 11 needs `all`, as it turns `root` down for a global
install; npm 10 ignores it). npm 12 then warns that it skipped three dependencies' install scripts; they aren't
needed. Without installing, `npx --allow-git=all --install-links github:lucio-ferrao/wassup` runs it from npm's cache
(the first time downloads the dependencies, about 100 MB). Or, from a clone: `npm install`, then `./wa` (or `npm
start`).

The first time, a QR code appears: on the phone, WhatsApp › Settings › Linked devices › Link a device. The session is
saved and later runs connect directly.

While you write in a chat the client announces itself "available" to WhatsApp, so the phone does not notify, just as
with WhatsApp Web open. Only writing counts (typing, deleting, pasting or sending): not opening it, the mouse, other
keys or getting the focus. After 2 minutes without writing it goes back to "unavailable", and at once when its window
or pane loses the focus, in terminals that report it (Herdr does). A message arriving in the chat you have open counts
as read only while you show as online and, in Herdr, its pane has the focus; otherwise it stays unread, and the phone
notifies, until you write, open the chat or come back to the terminal.

Requirements: Node 22.13 or newer (it uses the SQLite built into Node).

Language: Portuguese or English, from `WA_LANG` or the locale (`LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, `LANG`). It sets the interface
texts, the emoji names and the language of the writing suggestions.

## Interface

The tab bar at the top with the connection state on the right, messages across the full width under it, and under
them, as the conversation's next two messages, the other side's still to come and yours being written. The first is a
bubble in their messages' grey with the chat's name in the colour it has in groups, 👀 after it while the person is
online (in a group one per member online, up to five, among the 30 who wrote most recently), and, faint, "typing…"
with a braille spinner while they type, "online", or when they were last seen, which the server keeps as WhatsApp
tells it; while the messages are scrolled up, a line on from it says how many are below. Under it you write on your
bubbles' green, in a band as wide as your bubbles can be, so the text wraps where the message will, growing upwards
with it; when it's sent, the conversation first moves up to make room for it, and then the band narrows to the bubble
and rises into that room. Beyond the bubbles, no backgrounds of its own: the colours are the terminal theme's, and on
startup the terminal is asked for its real background colour to pick light or dark shades.

- **Tabs**: one per open chat, with the unread count in red and an `×` to close. Tab cycles through them, or, with
  only one open, opens the chat list; whatever is left unsent stays with each chat. While someone is typing in another
  chat, a braille spinner turns before its name in the tab. New messages in a chat without a tab open one without
  activating it, with a passing notice over it and the bell; an archived chat stays quiet.
- **Chats**: `wa` starts on the list, and `/`, or a click on the other side's name over the input, opens it again,
  under the app's name, most recent at the bottom, under day separators (today, yesterday, this week, older), a blank
  row between chats. Each takes two rows, its photo from WhatsApp on the left of both (four cells by two, real pixels
  with Kitty, half-blocks otherwise; its initials on its colour without one). On the first row, the name in its
  colour, 👀 while the person is online, and at the right edge when the last message was (`21:35`, `ontem 21:35`, `12
  set 21:35`); on a wide screen the list stops at 60 columns, so the time stays near the name. On the second, under
  the name, the unread count, or without unread messages the person's number (without the country code when it's the
  same as mine) or a group's number of members, and "typing…" while someone types. Photos, "abouts" and group sizes
  are asked of WhatsApp for the chats in view, at most once a day, and kept; a click on a photo opens it large, with
  its description, as images do. Typing after `wassup ❯` filters it word by word, ignoring accents and case, with the
  matches underlined; Enter, Tab, → or a click opens. Ctrl+F there searches the messages of every chat instead
  (`procurar ❯`, again or Esc back to the names): from two characters on, the list holds those that have all the
  words, the most recent at the bottom, each as its chat, who wrote it and when, and two lines of its text from a
  little before the match, the matches in reverse video; Enter or a click opens the chat on that message.
- **Messages**: yours on the right, each in a bubble with WhatsApp Web's colours where the terminal takes 24-bit
  colour (yours, on a dark theme, toned down to the brightness of theirs) and two discreet greys otherwise, with the
  time outside it, yours with their state in its separator (`14 06` not sent yet, `14.06` sent, `14:06` delivered;
  `14:06❮` the last of yours that was read) and a link's preview image inside it above the text; the pictures of
  images, stickers, videos and GIFs stay out of it, with their caption in it, and emoji on their own go bare; each day
  starts with a separator and a blank line. Mouse wheel or PgUp/PgDn; scrolling past the top brings older messages,
  first the stored ones and then from the phone, and Ctrl+↓ or Ctrl+PgDn goes back to the latest. An attachment not
  downloaded yet shows `⤓`: a click fetches it into the app's media folder, where it stays, and the mark goes; once
  there, a click opens it with `xdg-open` (`open` on macOS), except images and stickers, which open in a popup in the
  client, as large as it fits, with the local model's description under them, as do link previews; any key or click
  closes it. ↑ selects a message: typing replies to it, `:` reacts (erasing what was typed, down to nothing, drops the
  reply or the reaction), Backspace opens one of yours for editing, and Delete or Ctrl+D deletes it once pressed again
  (the band says how): yours for everyone, as the phone does, for two days after it was sent, and any other only for
  you. Mentions show the person's first name in their colour (`@Ana`); a click on one, or in a group on a member's
  name, opens the chat with them; a click on a pin (`📌 pinned a message`) goes to the message it's about. The `☺` next
  to a message under the pointer opens its quick reactions; a double click, dragging it to the right, or → with it
  selected, starts a reply. Ctrl+F searches the open chat's whole history, accents and case aside: the input becomes
  `procurar ❯`, the matches are shown in reverse video and the most recent one selected, ↑ goes to an older one and ↓
  to a newer one, with a count on the rule above the input; Enter stays on it, Esc closes.
- **Input**: grows with the text up to half the screen; what's being replied to, reacted to or edited shows on the
  band's first row; Enter sends, Shift+Enter or Ctrl+J start a new line, and pasting several lines keeps them. Ctrl-U
  clears, Shift-Backspace deletes a word (with the Kitty keyboard protocol). `:` and a letter open the emoji list;
  ↑/↓, Enter, Tab, → or a click pick one. In a group, `@` lists those who wrote in it, most recent first, narrowed by
  the start of any of their names (`@lem` finds Rita Lemos); the one picked goes in as `@Rita` (the whole name when
  two share the first), and the message goes out mentioning them, as the phone does.
- Esc closes, in order: the filter, the list, the active tab. Closing the last tab quits. Ctrl-C quits at once;
  Ctrl-R redraws the screen.
- **Several terminals**: the first process is the server with the WhatsApp connection; the next ones connect to it
  through a socket and are interface only, each with its own tabs. If the server ends, another one takes over.
- **Single chat**: `wa <name>` opens only that chat, without the tab bar or notices from others; the `/` list swaps
  it. An emoji on its own, as a message or a reaction, sends a big copy of it floating up the panel, drawn in block
  characters from the system's emoji font (the same glyph and colours the terminal shows), or, where the system has no
  colour one, from the Noto Color Emoji that comes with wassup; needs `sharp`.

### Herdr

Inside [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) wassup starts in single-chat mode and each chat is a Herdr tab or pane: in the list,
Enter puts the chat in this pane, → opens it in a new pane beside it and Tab in a new tab (all three focus the one
that already has it), and a message from a chat without one (and not archived) opens it in the background, in a pane
when its tab is already split and in a tab otherwise, still unread (so the phone notifies) until you go to it. Tab,
with nothing typed, moves to the next conversation's pane or tab, in the order Herdr shows them, or, with no other
one, opens the chat list. wassup shows up in Herdr's agent list under the chat's name alone: `working` while the other
person types, `done` (blue) from a new message (or when they stop typing) until you look at its pane, `idle`
otherwise; alone in its tab, the tab takes the contact's first name. Outside Herdr the terminal window title carries
the name, with `●` for unread messages or the spinner while they type.

### Formatting and emoji

WhatsApp markup is shown with terminal attributes: `*bold*`, `_italic_`, `~strikethrough~`, `` `code` ``, `> quote`.
When sending, write the markup as on the phone. `:name:` codes are replaced by the emoji as soon as the second `:` is
typed, with names in Portuguese and in English (`:thumbsup:` 👍, `:kissing_heart:` 😘, `:coffee:` ☕ …; the list is in
`src/emoji.ts`). The suggestion list (`:` and a letter) finds them by either language's names too, showing the
user's language's when both match; `:` on its own lists the basic smileys. Classic smileys (`:)`, `;)`, `<3` …) are
sent as typed: after one, on its own after a space, the list offers its emoji, which Tab or → take. Links are shown
without what only tracks who shared them (`fbclid`, `utm_…`, `igsh`, `si` and the many others in
[ClearURLs](https://github.com/ClearURLs/Rules)' rules, redirections through a site undone) and shortened (a long
path cut in the middle); from social networks and short links (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, TikTok, X,
`maps.app.goo.gl` …) only the readable parts stay, the opaque identifiers made `…` and the parameters left out
(`instagram.com/reel/…`, `instagram.com/stories/rita.lemos/…`, `youtube.com/watch`). A click copies the whole clean
link.

### Images

On startup the client asks the terminal what it can do, assuming nothing from `TERM`. In terminals with the Kitty
graphics protocol (Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, Konsole, iTerm2 3.7) images, stickers and thumbnails are shown for real
inside the panel; elsewhere, and inside Herdr (which doesn't pass the placements through), they are drawn with
coloured half-blocks, each the average colour of the area it covers: in 24-bit colour when the terminal confirms it
(XTGETTCAP or DECRQSS; Herdr does), in the 256-colour palette otherwise. `WA_IMAGES=kitty|blocks|none` forces the
mode, and `WA_COLORS=truecolor|256` the colours. In half-blocks, the selected image, sticker or link preview gets a
sentence or two from the local model (see below) on what it shows, beside it, or under it when there's no room.

## Writing suggestions

With a local `llama-server` at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (or `WA_LLM`), model `gemma4-26b` (or `WA_LLM_MODEL`), the
input asks for a suggestion shortly after the last key, with the latest messages as context: the letters missing from
the word being typed, right at the cursor, and every wrong passage already written (spelling, accents, grammar, a
missing comma) underlined in yellow, with the right word right above the one the cursor is on, or the last. Tab, →
or a click on it accept it; the others stay underlined. The prompt is in the user's language. `WA_LLM=off` turns the
model off. Without it (`WA_LLM=off`, or no server answering, then for a minute before asking again) a small local
spell checker stands in, words only, in the same way: Hunspell in WebAssembly with LibreOffice's Portuguese (Portugal)
and English dictionaries, a word being right in any of them; words you wrote yourself more than once and the names of
contacts and chats count as known, unless all they lack is an accent.

Your last text message is checked the same way once sent, and an earlier one when you select it, while WhatsApp still
lets them be edited (15 minutes): the wrong passages are underlined in yellow in the bubble; a click on one floats its
correction above it, and a click on that edits the message with it. The marks go when the 15 minutes are up.

## Data

Everything lives in `~/.config/wa` (or `WA_HOME`), readable by this user only (mode 700, umask 077 for whatever is
written):

| `wa.db` | SQLite with chats, contacts, messages and reactions |
| `media/<chat>/` | Downloaded attachments and thumbnails |
| `wa.log` | Log (level with `WA_LOG=info|debug`) |

History starts with what WhatsApp sends to new devices. `WA_FULL_HISTORY=1` asks for the full history when linking.
